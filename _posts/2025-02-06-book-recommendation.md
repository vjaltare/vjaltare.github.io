### Building a latent factor model for a book recommendation system
---

This was a class project I did with [Samira Sebt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samira-sebt/){:target="_blank"} for [CSE 258R](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa23/cse258-a/){:target="_blank"}.

We ended up writing a small paper about this that can be [found here!](/files/CSE_258R_Assignment_2.pdf)
