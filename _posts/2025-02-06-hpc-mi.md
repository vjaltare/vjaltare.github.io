This was my first project as a Ph.D. student. It was a project in conjunction with [this paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=7xTBMSkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=7xTBMSkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC){:target="_blank"} from my graduate student mentor [Yusi Chen](https://yschen13.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

[Here's a downloadable slidedeck](/files/hippocampus_EC_MI_presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"} of some of the results I got!
